    <p>Tokyo, the capital city of Japan, is a city where ultramodern architecture with its traditional counterpart.
      The city its self is a oxymoron filled from Robots roaming around the streets to traditional temples and shrines around the city.
      It is the centre of Japans business as the 11th most expensive city global and is ranked 1st as The World's Most Safest Cites.
      The question is less 'Why Tokyo ?' and more 'Why not Tokyo ?'
      Just remember you're not the only one who wants to go.
      With 24.04 million tourists going to Japan in 2016, wouldn't you want to be apart of the 2017 group ?
      So if you're still wondering "Why Japan ?" I think you should start thinking more about "What to do there ?" which will be explained further on.

    <h1>Trivia</h1>
      <h2>Samurais</h2>
      <img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/dc/77/c1/dc77c11e4522061ccae5b2283cdcec73--martial-arts-ninjas.jpg"
      alt="This picture is a samurai covered in his shadow under a sun. It is traditionally drawn using ink + brushes">
      <p>Samurais were warriors in the far east, mainly in Japan and China, who used special swords and fought for their morals
        sticking to their honor. They were quite self rightous and stood against anything they deemed wrong.
        Samurai were the military nobility and officer caste of medieval and early-modern Japan.

        In Japanese, they are usually referred to as bushi or buke.
        According to translator William Scott Wilson: "In Chinese, the character was originally a verb meaning "to wait upon", "accompany persons" in the upper ranks of society, and this is also true of the original term in Japanese, saburau.
        In both countries the terms were nominalized to mean "those who serve in close attendance to the nobility", the pronunciation in Japanese changing to saburai.
        According to Wilson, an early reference to the word "samurai" appears in the Kokin Wakash&#363; (905-914), the first imperial anthology of poems, completed in the first part of the 10th century.

      <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>

      alt="It is a picture of a human brain created by multiple electrical circuits flowing in different directions.">
      <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence exhibited by machines.
        In computer science, the field of AI research defines itself as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success at some goal.
        Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is applied when a machine mimics "cognitive" functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as "learning" and "problem solving".
        As machines become increasingly capable, mental facilities once thought to require intelligence are removed from the definition.
        For instance, optical character recognition is no longer perceived as an example of "artificial intelligence", having become a routine technology.
        Capabilities currently classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech, competing at a high level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go), autonomous cars, intelligent routing in content delivery networks, military simulations, and interpreting complex data.
