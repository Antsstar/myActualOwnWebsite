    <img src=https://www.laundrytown.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/tokyo-09.jpg>
    <p>Tokyo, the capital city of Japan, is a city where ultramodern architecture with its traditional counterpart.
      The city its self is a oxymoron filled from Robots roaming around the streets to traditional temples and shrines around the city.
      It is the centre of Japans business as the 11th most expensive city global and is ranked 1st as The World's Most Safest Cites.
      The question is less 'Why Tokyo ?' and more 'Why not Tokyo ?'
      Just remember you're not the only one who wants to go.
      With 24.04 million tourists going to Japan in 2016, wouldn't you want to be apart of the 2017 group ?
      So if you're still wondering "Why Japan ?" I think you should start thinking more about "What to do there ?" which will be explained further on.

    <h1>Trivia</h1>
      <h2>Samurais</h2>
      <img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/dc/77/c1/dc77c11e4522061ccae5b2283cdcec73--martial-arts-ninjas.jpg"
      alt="This picture is a samurai covered in his shadow under a sun. It is traditionally drawn using ink + brushes">
      <p>Samurais were warriors in the far east, mainly in Japan and China, who used special swords and fought for their morals
        sticking to their honor. They were quite self rightous and stood against anything they deemed wrong.
        Samurai were the military nobility and officer caste of medieval and early-modern Japan.

        In Japanese, they are usually referred to as bushi or buke.
        According to translator William Scott Wilson: "In Chinese, the character was originally a verb meaning "to wait upon", "accompany persons" in the upper ranks of society, and this is also true of the original term in Japanese, saburau.
        In both countries the terms were nominalized to mean "those who serve in close attendance to the nobility", the pronunciation in Japanese changing to saburai.
        According to Wilson, an early reference to the word "samurai" appears in the Kokin Wakash&#363; (905-914), the first imperial anthology of poems, completed in the first part of the 10th century.

      <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
      <img src="http://www.wolfgroup.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Artificisal-intelligence.jpg"
      alt="It is a picture of a human brain created by multiple electrical circuits flowing in different directions.">
      <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence exhibited by machines.
        In computer science, the field of AI research defines itself as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success at some goal.
        Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is applied when a machine mimics "cognitive" functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as "learning" and "problem solving".
        As machines become increasingly capable, mental facilities once thought to require intelligence are removed from the definition.
        For instance, optical character recognition is no longer perceived as an example of "artificial intelligence", having become a routine technology.
        Capabilities currently classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech, competing at a high level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go), autonomous cars, intelligent routing in content delivery networks, military simulations, and interpreting complex data.

      <h2>1. The Miraikan National Museum of Science and Innovation</h2>
      <img src="http://businesseventstokyo.org/uploads/2013/06/NMofES_Miraikan.jpg">
      <p>The National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation (Nippon Kagaku Mirai-kan), simply known as the Miraikan (literally "Future Museum"), is a museum created by Japan's Science and Technology Agency.
        It was opened in 2001. It is situated in a new purpose-built building in the Odaiba District of Tokyo.
        It can be reached by the Yurikamome driverless fully automated transit system from downtown Tokyo in about 15 minutes.
      </p>

    <div id="Pic2" class="Pictures" style="display:none">
      <h2>2. Koya-san</h2>
      <img src="http://cdn.touropia.com/gfx/d/best-places-to-visit-in-japan/koya_san.jpg?v=a9bb5ac3593388ef160659cac1b7fb2e">
      <p>Koya-san or Mount Koya is the most important site in Shingon Buddhism, a sect that has been practiced in Japan since 805 when it was introduced by Kobo Daishi.
        It remains the headquarters for the sect and the small town that grew up around the temple.
        The site of Kobo Daishi's mausoleum, this wooded Mount Koya is also the starting and ending place of the Shikoku 88 Temple Pilgrimage.
        Tourists can get a taste of the monk's life here as they are allowed to stay overnight in the temple.
      </p>

    <div id="Pic3" class="Pictures" style="display:none">
      <h2>3. Ishigaki</h2>
      <img src="http://cdn.touropia.com/gfx/d/best-places-to-visit-in-japan/ishigaki.jpg?v=3aa794ed1751640a405293aeaf7b703b">
      <p>Located west of Okinawa, Ishigaki is Japan's premier beach destination and makes a good base to explore the other islands in the Yaeyama archipelago.
        Blessed with Japan's best beaches, it is particularly popular with families since the beaches at Fusaki and Maezato are net-protected.
        Located 1,250 miles (2,000 kilometers) south of Tokyo, Ishigaki may not have the shrines and temples that other Japanese cities have, but it does have an exuberant nightlife for visitors who have the energy after a day of beachcombing, water sports or climbing Mount Nosoko.

      <h2>4. Hiroshima</h2>

      <p>Hiroshima, located on Honshu Island, is younger than many Japanese cities, less than 500 years old, but its fate was forever sealed in history on August 6, 1945, when it became the first city in the world to have an atomic bomb dropped on it.
        Thus, the city's attractions center around peace: Peace Park, Peace Memorial and Peace Memorial Museum.
        The city also has attractions that invoke more pleasant thoughts, such as Hiroshima Castle and the sunken garden of Shukkein-en.

      <p>Kyoto today is the capital only of Kyoto prefecture, but it once served as the imperial capital of Japan for more than 1,000 years.
        Located on central Honshu Island, this city of 1.5 million people is known as the City of 10,000 Shrines because it has thousands of Shinto shrines, including the top rated Fushimi Inari Shrine, and Buddhist temples.
        Kyoto also is known for its lovely gardens and the Gion Matsuri festival, a July celebration that is considered one of the best in Japan.

      <p>As the second largest city and a major business travel destination, Osaka is the home of several major international companies.
        But in addition to business, Osakan culture is also heavily focused on food.
        In fact, some lovers of Japanese cuisine view Osaka is the capital of affordable dining spree!
        Outside of the urban centers, pockets of tranquility are tucked away in the countryside.

      <p>A group of islands stretching southward from Japan, Okinawa is the country's equivalent of Hawaii.
        The islands have a unique indigenous culture and are popular for their sub-tropical climate and beautiful beaches.
        It's also renown for some of the world’s best diving spots and its incredible Churaumi Aquarium.

      <img src="http://www.neverstoptraveling.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Nobuhiro-Suhara-Himeji-Castle-800.jpg">
      <p>The greatest attraction for tourists to Hyogo prefecture is Himeji Castle, a UNESCO World Heritage site.
        It is one of the most impressive castles in all of Japan if not all of Asia.
        Close to Osaka, the prefecture is also home to the city of Kobe.
        It's considered by some to be one of Japan's most attractive cities, despite being leveled by a massive earthquake in 1995.

      <p>Travelers who like to mingle with people will love Tokyo.
        The Japanese capital's metropolitan area is the most populous in the world.
        From viewing spring cherry blossoms in traditional gardens to the fish market at Tuskiji.
        Tokyo blends the ancient with the new, from shrines to karaoke bars.
        Just walking the streets of this hyperactive city can be an energizing experience.
        When Tokyo's pace gets too frenetic, visitors recommend unwinding at the beautiful Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden.
